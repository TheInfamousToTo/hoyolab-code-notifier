Hey! 👋

Hope you're doing well! I've been following your content for a while and really enjoy what you do for the community.

I wanted to share something I built that might be useful for you and your Discord server - it's a bot that automatically posts new redemption codes for Genshin (and Star Rail/ZZZ too) directly to your Discord the moment they go live.

No more manually checking for codes or missing out on freebies! Your community gets notified instantly with the code, what rewards it gives, and a direct redeem link.

Here's how it looks: the bot posts as "Paimon" with the game icon, so it fits right in with the Genshin vibe 😄

If you're interested, I'd be happy to set it up for your server - all I'd need from you is a Discord webhook URL (super easy to create, takes like 30 seconds). I'll handle all the technical stuff.

you can also do it by your self , super easy and more secure than trusing me !


Here's the project if you wanna check it out:

Let me know if you have any questions or want me to set it up for you!

Cheers! ✌️
